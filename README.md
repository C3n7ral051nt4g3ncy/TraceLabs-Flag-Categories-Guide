# The most important tips for newbies

I've participated in five Trace Labs events, and I take each event very seriously. Among these, my teams achieved **2 silver badges** coming in at 2nd Place, **a gold badge (previously known as a Black Badge) for winning the event**, and a sixth-place finish. <br>
Unfortunately, the 5th event led to our disqualification due to a rookie teammate unknowingly breaking the rules. 

It underscores the importance of:

**Reading the Rules**: Before participating, ensure you're familiar with the official rules. <br>
The rules can be found here --> https://www.tracelabs.org/about/search-party-rules

**Joining the Trace Labs Discord Server**: Engage and stay informed through the Trace Labs Discord server --> https://discord.com/invite/tracelabs

**Remember, in team events, individual actions can impact everyone. Always be considerate of your teammates, take the time to read the rules.**

# Judges Tips

**Trace Labs judges are volunteers from the cyber community, always treat them with kindness and respect.**

<br>**When you submit:**

- Remember that your assigned judge knows just as much about the case as you do!
- The judge has not worked on the case and has no prior knowledge of it
- This means that when you submit, you need to explain the findings to your judge, how you found this information, how you can be sure of it, what proves it, how you came to this conclusion.
- Submitting poorly explained information, wrong information, or the same information many times will only lead to making the event less user-friendly for you and your team, it gives the judge a lot more work to do, it gives the Trace labs staff a lot more work to do, it will also make your team look bad, and the judge needs to trust you and your team and the information you are submitting.


**If you feel that a perfectly good and legitimate flag was rejected:**

- Talk to your judge about it on the Trace Labs Discord server and open a ticket
- Send a mesage to the Trace Labs staff and they will look into it.

## Friends - 10 points
Information relating to friends of the Missing Person

What to do ✅ :
- Submit profiles of friends on social media who have interacted with the MP!
- Pertinent data linked to friends of the MP pertinent to the investigation.
- This can encompass notable interactions between "friends" and the MP, significant photos from friends' social media, remarks or posts from friends about the MP's disappearance, and more.

What not to do ❌:
- Do not submit information on social media friends who are not proven to be the friends of the missing person or people the MP interacts with.
- Example: The missing person has 1200 facebook friends, it would be pointless submitted the 1200 facebook friends list.
